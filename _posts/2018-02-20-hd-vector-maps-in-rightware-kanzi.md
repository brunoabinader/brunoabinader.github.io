Rightware’s Kanzi Studio is like Photoshop for designing and building the human-machine interface (HMI) in cars and other interfaces for the automotive industry. The latest Kanzi Studio plug-in now adds our [HD Vector Maps](/millimeter-precision-hd-vector-maps-874327d8327c) into their 3D design environment. From digital instrument clusters to infotainment (IVI) systems to head-up displays (HUDs) the Kanzi software is deployed by 35 automotive brands and live in millions of cars worldwide. Here is a look at the new maps design studio:

The HD Vector Maps use Protocol Buffers for serialization and it is optimized to the exact resolution required by the dataset. This makes streaming streets, satellite imagery, and terrain data into Kanzi insanely fast and radically saves bandwidth for streaming data to a car and reduces storage size for larger area coverage offline. Vector tiles offer styling flexibility, and the result is accelerated development while introducing a unique appearance, true to the OEM brand identity.
