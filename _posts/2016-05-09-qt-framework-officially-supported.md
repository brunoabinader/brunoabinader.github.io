[Mapbox GL Native](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native) now officially supports [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), an open-source cross-platform application framework designed to _write once, deploy everywhere_. Qt is widely used in many industries, including mobile, automotive, avionics and much more due to its fast development cycle, extensive documentation and big community.

We are committed to Qt and Mapbox GL Native now welcomes it as a first-class platform. [Mapbox Qt SDK](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/tree/master/platform/qt) provides `QMapboxGL` and `QQuickMapboxGL`.

`QMapboxGL` and `QQuickMapboxGL` solve different problems. The former is a low-level implementation that can be used on previous versions of Qt and is easily integrated into pure C++ environments. The latter takes advantage of Qt Quickâ€™s modern user interface technology, and is the perfect tool for adding navigation maps on embedded platforms.

Grab our open source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native) and join us at [QtCon](https://blog.qt.io/blog/2016/02/18/qtcon-in-berlin-1st-4th-september-2016/) this September in Berlin.
