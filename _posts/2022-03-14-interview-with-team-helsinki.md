#### _Bruno, you’re part of the Helsinki office as a co-founder. Tell us more about what you do and what the team in Helsinki works on._

**Bruno:** I joined Mapbox in 2015, just three months after Thiago, who invited me to join this _“cool SF-based startup doing amazing tech with maps!”_.

I started as a Software Engineer in the GL Native team and focused on the ongoing partnerships with our automotive customers which eventually led me into building a spin-off team named Core SDK in 2019, where I am currently an Engineering Manager.

The Core SDK team initially was responsible for providing custom-tailored solutions to our automotive customers. That work has helped us to learn about opportunities for converging solutions across teams, and we have since changed its scope to being a platform team providing shared solutions to our internal SDK teams.

Today, the Helsinki team spans beyond hosting both GL Native and Core SDK teams, and also includes Android, iOS, graphics, and backend engineers, map designers, and many more [exciting roles](https://www.mapbox.com/careers) that we have open!

#### _What are the biggest projects and customers you get to work with in Helsinki that you can share with us?_

‍**Bruno:** My very first project at Mapbox was about adapting our maps rendering engine to run inside a leading EV manufacturer’s user interface. Back then, the customer had its UI implemented in Qt and Thiago had just the right proof of concept ready. Thus, the work Thiago and I did implementing the Mapbox Maps SDK for Qt has been key to some of our early automotive partnerships. Starting with our [Qt framework official support](https://blog.mapbox.com/qt-framework-officially-supported-40b60bfbb0d0), then leading to a [Qt Navigation SDK for automotive and embedded devices](https://blog.mapbox.com/qt-navigation-sdk-for-automotive-and-embedded-devices-cbd8c95fe343), as well as implementing [HD Vector Maps in Rightware’s Kanzi](https://blog.mapbox.com/hd-vector-maps-in-rightwares-kanzi-2f6363a44700).

I worked closely with automotive partners like the [Qt Company](https://www.qt.io/company), [Rightware](https://rightware.com/), and [NNG](https://nng.com/), as well as customers like [Rimac](https://www.rimac-automobili.com/), [Porsche](https://www.porsche.com/), and others.
