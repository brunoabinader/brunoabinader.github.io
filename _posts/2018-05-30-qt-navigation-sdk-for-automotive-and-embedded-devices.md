The [Mapbox Navigation SDK for Qt](https://www.mapbox.com/qt/) is now available with [the latest Qt 5.11 release](https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/05/22/qt-5-11-released/), enabling turn-by-turn navigation with real-time traffic, lane level guidance, and voice instructions. These features add to the beautiful hardware accelerated vector maps and address/point of interest search that we’ve made available since Qt 5.9.

The SDK comes with professionally-designed [maps for navigation](https://blog.mapbox.com/designing-maps-for-navigation-186fe1c67363) and user interface templates optimized for driver safety and efficiency — only the most important information is surfaced to drivers at the right time. The maps and UI are also fully customizable.

<em class="center" style="text-align:center;">The Navigation SDK for Qt is a drop-in library that adds turn-by-turn navigation to automotive and embedded applications.</em>

We partnered closely with the Qt Company to build the first navigation solution for Qt Location, delivering maps, search, and routing services through Qt Location APIs. This release makes the Navigation SDK available as a new [Navigator QML Type](http://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-5.11/qml-navigator.html) allowing for ease of integration via QML.

The [Navigation SDK for Qt](https://www.mapbox.com/qt/) is now available in alpha release. For more information and to enroll as an alpha tester, head to [mapbox.com/qt](https://www.mapbox.com/qt/) and sign up.
