Hi! :wave: My name is Bruno Abinader and this is the latest iteration of my blog posting activities. This time, I am
calling it _Code & Thoughts_.

I write about open-source development, programming languages, build systems, and shell scripts.

## Bio

![Bruno Abinader](/assets/images/bruno.jpg){:class="round center"}{:width="400"}

I started contributing to open-source projects since the early 2000s, and have since contributed to projects like [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/), [DigiKam](https://www.digikam.org/), [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), [WebKit](https://webkit.org/), [Chromium Blink](https://www.chromium.org/blink/), [Mozilla Servo](https://servo.org/), [ASIO C++ Library](https://think-async.com/Asio/), and [Mapbox GL Native](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native), among others.

I graduated in 2007 as a Bachelor of Computer Science at the _Universidade Federal do Amazonas_ ([UFAM](https://ufam.edu.br/)) in Brazil and right after I started my career as a Software Engineer at _[Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/) Institute of Technology_ ([INdT](https://www.indt.org.br/)) in Brazil developing open-source projects for Linux-based embedded devices like the [Nokia 770](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_770_Internet_Tablet), [Nokia N800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N800), and the [Nokia N810](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N810) Internet Tablets, and smartphones like the [Nokia N900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900) and the [Nokia N9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N9).

Apart from the undisclosed projects, some notable references include [Carman](https://garage.maemo.org/projects/carman), an [OBD-II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics#OBD-II) analyzer for [Maemo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maemo) implemented using, and [python-purple](https://github.com/Flared/python-purple), a provider of Python bindings for [libpurple](https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/WhatIsLibpurple) using [Cython](https://cython.org/) that I co-founded. There, I had my first interaction with mapping software implementing location sharing with friends in real-time using a simple [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/)-based protocol for Carman in 2007, 2 years before [Google Latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Latitude) first release :smile:

At [Samsung](https://www.sra.samsung.com/), I have spent a couple of years dedicated to open-source web engines development. My initial focus area was implementing the [CSS Text Decoration Module Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-decor-3/) properties in both Apple's WebKit and Google's Blink engines.

Examples:
<span style="text-decoration: underline red;">underline</span> <span style="text-decoration: overline green;">overline</span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through blue;">line-through</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline dotted">dotted</span>
<span style="text-decoration: overline wavy">wavy</span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through double">double</span>

Later on, I contributed in the early days of Mozilla Servo's development by implementing DOM, CSS, and HTML-related properties. With Servo, I had the opportunity to learn Rust, back then in alpha version.

At [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), I have started as a Software Engineer for the GL Native team from Helsinki in 2015, porting the [`circle` layer](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/layers/#circle) support from GL JS to GL Native as part of my hiring sprint (in two days! :rocket:).

<em class="center" style="text-align:center;">My first contribution to Mapbox :heart:</em>

Since then, I worked in various projects in close relationship with automotive and mobile customers including the Qt port of Mapbox GL Native and its inclusion as an official [QtLocation plugin](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/location-plugin-mapboxgl.html).

Currently, I work as an Engineering Manager at Mapbox for the Core SDK team, an internal platform team providing shared foundational components to all Mapbox SDKs.

Over the years, I have presented in various summits, conferences, and workshops:
